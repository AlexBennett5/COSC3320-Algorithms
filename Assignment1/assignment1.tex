\section*{Problem 1}

The task of this problem is to move $n$ disks of increasing size from one peg to another using a Tower of Hanoi graph. We have six pegs: START, DEST, and four AUX pegs. Once a disk is removed from START it cannot return and likewise once a disk is moved to DEST it cannot be moved back onto any of the others. The four AUX pegs form a looping cycle, with START and DEST connected to the same peg, AUX1. We want to know how many moves it will take to move the $n$ disks from the starting peg to the destination peg.

Our algorithm works as follows: if $n$ is one, then we can simply move the disk from START to AUX1 to DEST in 2 moves. For $n$ greater than one we must move the top $n-1$ disks to somewhere in the cycle other than the AUX1 peg (for our purpose let's say we move it to AUX4 with a function called $H_{\text{START}}$). We then move the bottom disk from START to DEST. 

Now that all remaining disks are in the cycle the problem is similar to a standard cyclic Tower of Hanoi problem, only with the DEST peg not included in the cycle. We will use a function $H_{\text{DEST}}$ that cycles the $k$ remaining disks from AUX4 to AUX1, moves the top $k-1$ disks back to AUX4, moves the bottom disk on AUX1 to DEST, and repeats. Both $H_{\text{START}}$ and $H_{\text{DEST}}$ require auxiliary functions $H_1, H_2, H_3$ where $H_i$ is a function to move a tower of $n$ disks $i$ spots ahead in the cycle.

For $H_1, H_2, H_3$ we have the asymptotic upper bounds of $O(n3^n), O(3^n), O(n3^n)$ respectively. Our recursive definition for the start function is $H_{\text{START}}(n) = H_{\text{START}}(n-1) + H_2(n-1) + H_2(n-1)$ so $H_{\text{START}}(n) = O(n3^n)$. For $H_{\text{DEST}}$ we use a for-loop that repeatedly uses $H_1$ and $H_3$ so $H_{\text{DEST}} = O(n^23^n)$. For the entire algorithm, $H_T$, we have $H_T(n) = H_{\text{START}}(n-1) + H_{\text{DEST}}(1) + H_1(n-1) + H_{\text{DEST}}(n-1)$, which means the algorithm has a worst case time complexity of $O(n^23^n)$.

The recursion depth for each constituent function of $H_T$ is $O(n)$ so the space complexity for the algorithm is $O(n)$.

\section*{Problem 2}

For $(a)$ memory is mapped in row-major order. Thus for $A[I,J] = A[I,J]* B[I,J]$ we have two pages per row. Thus for each $I$ loop we have two reads to $A$, two reads to $B$, and two writes to $A$. For $B[I,J] = C[N-I+1,J] * B[I,J]$ since $B[I,J]$ is already in memory for each $I$ loop we have two writes to $B$ and two writes to $C$. Thus we have $(2*2*2)*4000 + (2*2)*4000 = 48000$ transfers in total.

For $(b)$ memory is mapped in column-major order. Each row and column has 4000 pages. For each $I$ loop we have three reads and two writes, so in total we have $2*4000*4000 + 3*4000*4000 = 80000000$ transfers.

\section*{Problem 3}

QuickSort is an algorithm that works by taking a list of values (in our case an array of integers), selecting a pivot value from the list, and sorting all remaining values into two subarrays - one comprised of elements greater than the pivot and one of elements less than the pivot. The algorithm is applied recursively until the array is sorted.

Generally the best case input for QuickSort is one where the size of the two subarrays are the same for each choice of pivot. The worst case input is one where the pivot is the smallest or greatest value in the list. Since our pivot is always the first element, this means the worst cast input would be a sorted array.

The algorithm below uses a Hoare partition scheme. In the standard Lomuto partition scheme QuickSort is inefficient for array input where every element of the array has the same value. For the Hoare partition scheme an array where every element is the same sorts as efficiently as an array where the subarrays generated by the pivot are always equal in size.

Thus for any input $n$ the algorithm below produces an array of length $n$ where every element is the same (our optimal case) and an array of length $n$ that is already sorted in ascending order (our inefficient case). The algorithm has an upper bound of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case and $O(n\log n)$ in the best case.

\section*{Problem 4}

For this problem we are testing the timing of a simple C program which allocates memory for a sequence of arrays, deallocates all even numbered arrays in that sequence, then allocates a smaller sequence of larger arrays. Our question is whether there is much difference in timing between the first and second allocations.

\subsection*{Hypothesis}

The first and second allocation will have roughly the same timing. As long as the input $m$ doesn't result in a segmentation fault, allocating memory for the first sequence of arrays and allocating memory for the second should have roughly the same time complexity.

\subsection*{Procedure}

I tested the below program with a variety of inputs of $m$ until I started running out of memory. I discovered $m = 200000$ to be around the upper limit of what the program could accept without resulting in a memory error.

#include <time.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[] ) {

	char *arg = argv[1];
	int m = atoi(arg);

	int *arrs_800[3*m];	

	clock_t begin1 = clock();

	for (int i = 0; i < (3*m); i++) {
		int *temp = (int *)malloc(800000);
		arrs_800[i] = temp;
	}

	clock_t end1 = clock();
	int time_elapsed = (double)(end1 - begin1) /(CLOCKS_PER_SEC/1000);
	printf("Time elapsed for first allocation is %d milliseconds\n", time_elapsed);

	for (int i = 0; i < (3*m); i+= 2) {
		free(arrs_800[i]);
	}

	int *arrs_mil[m];
	
	clock_t begin2 = clock();

	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int *temp = (int *)malloc(1000000);
		arrs_mil[i] = temp;
	}
	
	clock_t end2 = clock();
	time_elapsed = (double)(end2 - begin2) / (CLOCKS_PER_SEC/1000);
	printf("Time elapsed for second allocation is %d milliseconds\n", time_elapsed);
}

\end{minted}

\subsection*{Results}

The average runtime for each allocation over ten trials with $m = 200000$ was 730 milliseconds for the first allocation and 731915 milliseconds for the second allocation.

\subsection*{Explanation}

My hypothesis was incorrect: the second allocation took significantly longer than the first. The reason for this has to do with the deallocation process. When the even arrays are deallocated after the first loop there is technically enough memory for the second loop, but it is not accessible to the second loop until the memory is defragmented. The time it takes to defragment the memory is the reason for the disparity between the two loops.

\section*{Problem 5}

For this problem we are testing a binary search algorithm in three significantly different programming languages (Java, C, Python). We want to find out whether the timing for the algorithm differs depending on which language it is written in.

\subsection*{Hypothesis}

C will perform faster than Java and Java faster than Python. C is a compiled language which tend to be faster than semi-interpreted languages like Java and fully interpreted languages like Python.

\subsection*{Procedure}

All three algorithms are similar in structure. Each has a function that declares an integer array of size $n$, with every element of the array the value $v - 1$ for given target value $v$. The same unsuccessful binary search is run ten million times and the run time is printed to standard output. The algorithm runs this function for the different test cases of $n$ specified by the problem.

\subsection*{Explanation}

My hypothesis that C would be faster than both Java and Python turned out to be incorrect. C was slower than Java. This is a surprising result since Java requires more memory than C and garbage collection is slower than managing memory manually. The reason for this seems to be the C compiler. The C code was compiled using the gcc command line compiler and the default optimization setting for gcc is rather poor. Testing other optimization settings I found the C code to be remarkably fast, and much faster than the Java version.

However, my hypothesis was partly correct in that Python was far and away the slowest. This is due to Python being a dynamically-typed, interpreted language. Interpreters lack the speed of compilers since they cannot "look ahead" and make optimizations.

It is worth noting that despite the variable runtimes for all three algorithms, they all grew with an asymptotic upper bound of $O(\log n)$, which is the expected time complexity of a binary search.
